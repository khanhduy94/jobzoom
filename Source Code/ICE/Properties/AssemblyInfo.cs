[assembly: AssemblyDescription("While search engines and taxonomy tools greatly enhance search experience, some information, and more specifically relationships between information, are not easy to communicate with traditional text or HTML output. Exposing those relationships would complement existing search tools and would most of all enable the discovery of information through its connections with other information, and that's the objective of project ICE.
